# LonData

A free iOS iPhone / iPad app that displays pollution data in London - get it at https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/londata/id1555741956 .

I was keen to try out SwiftUI maps so made this app as a fun learning project.

<sub>It was originally intended to also provide corona statistics from the UK open data api (hence the generic name LonData), however this was deemed against app store regulations (only certain official apps are allowed to reference coronavirus). This feature was therefore taken out.</sub>
